Dotfiles for the Genome setup

Here you can find the dotfiles for my latest setup. Feel free to create an issue if I'm missing something

NOTE: These dots are intended for my setup. If you wish to use them (and feel free to take them and tinker around), you will have to make specific modifications
for your own machine. I'll do my best to answer questions related to parameters that may need to be changed
